My new developer portfolio website, featuring a range of my web, mobile and hackathon projects as well as detailing my experience and skills.

Built using React.js and LESS, also used as my 'devops playground' with GitHub Pages for my continious integration, Sentry for the error tracking and Google Analytics for tracking, as well as a place where I try out other DevOps tools.
